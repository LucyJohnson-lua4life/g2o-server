# IMPORTANT

G2O Server requires **data.xml** file, without it, it won't work properly!
You need to generate this file by yourself, in order to do that:

1. Run the default G2O Server
2. Join the server
3. Open up ingame debug console (tilde key)
4. Type: `generate data`
5. Copy the generated **data.xml** from `YOUR_GAME_PATH/Multiplayer/data.xml` to `SERVER_ROOT/data.xml`
6. Uncomment loading of **data.xml** file in **config.xml**

#### This file needs to be regenerated when you introduce new changes to:
- your game scripts (**gothic.dat**)
- your model scripts (.mds, e.g: **Humans.mds**)
